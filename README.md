# NodeCounter

# What?
A program for practicing binary tree traversal

# Who?
Me, a student knowing data structures are important and trying desperately to figure them out, 
but finding the whole thing very abstract, boring, and otherwise hard to follow.

# Why?
I couldn't remember anything about binary tree traversal. Where do I start? why? Why do I have to suddenly jump over there?
This simplifies it down to "this is how it's done", and the gamification makes learning the route much more enjoyable.

# Why 2.0
I chose JavaFX for this project because I've only done one other project with it, but even then I knew how
wide open the possibilities were.  Being able to use SceneBuilder was a definite plus.

# How?
To play, simply choose what kind of binary tree traversal you wish to practice, then click each node to
create a number in sequence. If correct, the node will change color. Clicking the nodes again will erase the
numbers and set the counter back. If you count all the nodes correctly before the timer runs out, you win!
